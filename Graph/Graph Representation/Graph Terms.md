## what is a graph?

Graph is a non-linear data structure that is store the data in the from of nodes and edges connecting them

**or** Graph is a mathematical structures that describes the relationship between to objects 


### Graph consists of two components:

### Nodes:

are usually denoted by circles or ovals

### Edges:

are the connection between the nodes

### Edges can be directed or undirectedâ€¦ weighted or unweighted that depends on the problem

## Bi-directional road || undirected Graph

in **undirected graph** the edges between nodes are bidirectional (**with no direction associated with them)** 

Simply, the graph can traversed in either direction. 

the absence of arrows tells us this is an **undirected graph**

see the code from [here](/Graph/Graph%20Representation/Undirected.md/#add-undirected-unweighted)

## Directed Graph || one way road

this is also a set of nodes and edges connecting these nodes but this time edges having a direction associated with it.

**Edges** are usually represented by arrows pointing in the direction the graph can be traversed

see the code from [here](/Graph/Graph%20Representation/Directed.md/#add-directed-unweighted)

## Weighted Graph

weighted graph is a special type of graphs and this is a graph which each edge is given a numerical **cost** or **weight** 

weighted graph can be **directed or undirected**

see the code for [weighted undirected graph](/Graph/Graph%20Representation/Undirected.md/#add-undirected-weighted) 

and [weighted directed graph](/Graph/Graph%20Representation/Directed.md/#add-directed-weighted)

## Tree

a tree is an undirected graph in which any two nodes are connected to each other by exactly one path and there is no cycles **(acyclic)**

in other words tree consisting of **N nodes** and **N-1 edges !**

## Forest

undirected, disconnected, acyclic Graph 

in other words, a disjoint collection of tree is known as forest

Each component of **forest** is a **tree** 



## Cyclic Graph

cyclic Graph that is a graph that consist a cycle

## Acyclic Graph

acyclic Graph that is a graph that without cycles 

### Cycle: is a complete circuit

## Bipartite graph

is a graph in which set of nodes can be divided into two independent sets and no two graph nodes within the same set are adjacent
